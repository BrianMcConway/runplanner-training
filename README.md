## Project Planning

### Agile Methodologies - Project Management

I used Agile methodologies to manage the development process effectively. By utilizing GitHub's project management tools, I created and tracked issues to break down tasks and stay organized. Milestones were used to group related tasks, helping to track progress toward key goals. This approach provided a clear roadmap, allowing for regular assessments and adjustments as needed. GitHubâ€™s tools helped ensure that the project stayed on track and adaptable throughout the development process.

  <img src="" alt="Database Schema Diagram" width="600"/>

### Database Schema and Relationships

The database schema . Below is an explanation of the key models and their relationships:

1.
3. 
4. **Django's Built-in Models**:
   - The schema also includes several built-in Django models like `Group`, `Permission`, `ContentType`, `Session`, and models from the `django.contrib.auth` and `django.contrib.admin` apps.
   - These models provide functionalities such as user permissions, session management, and content type information.
   - The `LogEntry` model is particularly used for tracking administrative actions within the Django admin interface.

5. **Allauth Models**:
   - Models like `EmailAddress`, `EmailConfirmation`, `SocialAccount`, `SocialApp`, and `SocialToken` are part of the Django Allauth package, which manages user authentication, including email verification and social account integration.
   - These models establish relationships with the `User` model, ensuring that email confirmations and social account data are properly linked to individual users.

6. **Permissions and Groups**:
   

### Relationship Summary

The diagram illustrates the relationships between these models:

- **One-to-One Relationship**: 
   - Between `User` and `Profile`.

- **One-to-Many Relationship**:
   
- **Many-to-Many Relationship**:
   
- **Foreign Key Relationships**:
   

This schema effectively manages the complexity of user data, authentication, and uploaded content, ensuring that the Brendan Doyle Running Club application can serve its members effectively while maintaining robust security and data integrity.

## Security

### Overview

Ensuring the security of user data and the integrity of the application is a top priority. The following measures have been implemented to secure the Brendan Doyle Running Club website:

### 1. Environmental Variables

Sensitive information, such as API keys, database credentials, and secret keys, is stored in environment variables. This approach ensures that these details are not hard-coded into the codebase and are not exposed in the version control system (e.g., GitHub).

To manage environment variables, the project uses the `django-environ` package. Key configurations include:

- **SECRET_KEY**: This is the secret key used by Django for cryptographic signing. It is kept as an environment variable to prevent exposure.
- **DATABASE_URL**: Connection string for the PostgreSQL database.
- **CLOUDINARY_URL**: URL for Cloudinary API integration.
- **EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD**: Password for the email service used by the application.
- **GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY**: API key for Google Maps integration.

These environment variables are loaded securely and used throughout the application, ensuring that sensitive data is protected.

### 2. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection

To prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, Django provides built-in middleware. The following settings have been enabled to enhance CSRF protection:

- **CSRF_COOKIE_HTTPONLY = True**: This setting ensures that the CSRF cookie is only accessible via HTTP(S) requests, which means it cannot be accessed by client-side JavaScript. This adds a layer of security by preventing malicious scripts from hijacking the CSRF token.
  
- **CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True**: This setting ensures that the CSRF cookie is only sent over HTTPS, preventing it from being intercepted in transit. This is particularly important when the site is served over HTTPS, as it ensures that the token is not exposed over insecure connections.

### 3. Secure Cookies

In addition to securing the CSRF cookie, the following settings have been applied to secure the session cookies:

- **SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True**: Ensures that the session cookie is only sent over HTTPS, protecting it from being intercepted over insecure connections.

- **SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY = True**: Prevents client-side scripts from accessing the session cookie, reducing the risk of XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks.

### 4. Content Security Policy (CSP)

While Django does not enforce Content Security Policy (CSP) by default, implementing a CSP is recommended to prevent a wide range of attacks, including XSS. A CSP can be configured to restrict the sources from which content can be loaded.

### 5. HTTPS

The application is served over HTTPS, ensuring that all data transmitted between the client and server is encrypted. This helps protect against man-in-the-middle attacks.

### 6. User Authentication and Permissions

- **Django Allauth**: The application uses Django Allauth for robust user authentication, including email verification and social account integration.
- **Custom Permissions**: Certain views and functionalities are restricted to authenticated users. The members area, for example, is accessible only to verified members.
