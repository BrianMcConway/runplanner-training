### Database Schema

**Database Schema Diagram**

<img src="static/images/schema.png" alt="Database Schema Diagram" width="600"/>

### Database Schema and Relationships

The database schema represents the structure of the application, including custom models, built-in Django models, and third-party app integrations. Below is an explanation of the key models and their relationships:

1. **User Model**:
   - Built on Django's `AbstractBaseUser` and `PermissionsMixin`.
   - Fields: `username`, `email`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `is_active`, `is_staff`, `is_superuser`, and more.
   - **Relationships**:
     - Many-to-Many with `Group` for role-based permissions.
     - Many-to-Many with `Permission` for individual user permissions.
     - Related to `BasketItem`, `Purchase`, `Order`, `SocialAccount`, and comments/posts.

2. **Product Model**:
   - Represents items available for purchase, such as training plans.
   - Fields: `name`, `category`, `price`, `difficulty`, `description`, etc.
   - **Relationships**:
     - One-to-Many with `BasketItem`.
     - One-to-Many with `OrderLineItem`.

3. **Order and OrderLineItem Models**:
   - **Order**:
     - Represents a purchase order.
     - Fields: `full_name`, `email`, `grand_total`, `stripe_pid`, and address fields.
     - **Relationships**:
       - One-to-Many with `OrderLineItem` (an order can contain multiple items).
   - **OrderLineItem**:
     - Tracks individual items in an order.
     - Fields: `quantity`, `lineitem_total`.
     - **Relationships**:
       - Belongs to an `Order`.
       - Refers to a `Product`.

4. **BasketItem Model**:
   - Represents items added to a user's basket (shopping cart).
   - Fields: `quantity`.
   - **Relationships**:
     - Belongs to a `User`.
     - Refers to a `Product`.

5. **Purchase Model**:
   - Tracks specific training plans purchased by users.
   - Fields: `payment_verified`, `purchase_date`.
   - **Relationships**:
     - Belongs to a `User`.
     - Refers to a `Product` (training plan).

6. **Django's Built-in Models**:
   - The schema includes built-in Django models like `Group`, `Permission`, `ContentType`, `Session`, and models from `django.contrib.auth`.
   - **Functionality**:
     - Manage user permissions, session handling, and content types.
     - The `LogEntry` model tracks administrative actions within the Django admin interface.

7. **Allauth Models**:

   - Part of the Django Allauth package, managing user authentication, email verification, and social account integrations.
   - **Relationships**:
     - Establish links between `User` and social authentication services or email confirmation records.

8. **ContactMessage Model**:
   - Stores messages submitted via a "Contact Us" form.
   - Fields: `name`, `email`, `subject`, `message`.

9. **Comment and Post Models**:
   - Implements a simple blog or post-comment system.
   - **Post**:
     - Represents blog posts or updates.
     - Related to `User` as `author`.
   - **Comment**:
     - Tracks comments on posts.
     - Related to `Post` and `User`.

---

### Relationship Summary

The diagram illustrates the relationships between these models:

- **One-to-One Relationships**:
   - Between `User` and models for social account data or email verification (via Allauth).

- **One-to-Many Relationships**:
   - Between `Order` and `OrderLineItem` (an order contains multiple items).
   - Between `Product` and `BasketItem` or `OrderLineItem`.

- **Many-to-Many Relationships**:
   - Between `User` and `Group` for role-based permissions.
   - Between `User` and `Permission` for individual user permissions.

- **Foreign Key Relationships**:
   - `BasketItem` links `User` to `Product`.
   - `Purchase` links `User` to `Product`.
   - `OrderLineItem` links `Order` to `Product`.

This schema effectively organizes user data, authentication, purchases, and content, ensuring scalability and security for the application's core functionalities.

## Security

### Overview

Ensuring the security of user data and the integrity of the application is a top priority. The following measures have been implemented to secure the Brendan Doyle Running Club website:

### 1. Environmental Variables

Sensitive information, such as API keys, database credentials, and secret keys, is stored in environment variables. This approach ensures that these details are not hard-coded into the codebase and are not exposed in the version control system (e.g., GitHub).

To manage environment variables, the project uses the `django-environ` package. Key configurations include:

- **SECRET_KEY**: This is the secret key used by Django for cryptographic signing. It is kept as an environment variable to prevent exposure.
- **DATABASE_URL**: Connection string for the PostgreSQL database.
- **EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD**: Password for the email service used by the application.
- **STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY**: Key for using the Stripe payment system.

These environment variables are loaded securely and used throughout the application, ensuring that sensitive data is protected.

### 2. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection

To prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, Django provides built-in middleware. The following settings have been enabled to enhance CSRF protection:

- **CSRF_COOKIE_HTTPONLY = True**: This setting ensures that the CSRF cookie is only accessible via HTTP(S) requests, which means it cannot be accessed by client-side JavaScript. This adds a layer of security by preventing malicious scripts from hijacking the CSRF token.
  
- **CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True**: This setting ensures that the CSRF cookie is only sent over HTTPS, preventing it from being intercepted in transit. This is particularly important when the site is served over HTTPS, as it ensures that the token is not exposed over insecure connections.

### 3. Secure Cookies

In addition to securing the CSRF cookie, the following settings have been applied to secure the session cookies:

- **SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True**: Ensures that the session cookie is only sent over HTTPS, protecting it from being intercepted over insecure connections.

- **SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY = True**: Prevents client-side scripts from accessing the session cookie, reducing the risk of XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks.

### 4. Content Security Policy (CSP)

While Django does not enforce Content Security Policy (CSP) by default, implementing a CSP is recommended to prevent a wide range of attacks, including XSS. A CSP can be configured to restrict the sources from which content can be loaded.

### 5. HTTPS

The application is served over HTTPS, ensuring that all data transmitted between the client and server is encrypted. This helps protect against man-in-the-middle attacks.

### 6. User Authentication and Permissions

- **Django Allauth**: The application uses Django Allauth for robust user authentication, including email verification and social account integration.
- **Custom Permissions**: Certain views and functionalities are restricted to authenticated users. The members area, for example, is accessible only to verified members.


## Features


### User Views and Features - Non-members/Members

### CRUD Functionality
Detail the Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities implemented in the project.

### Feature Showcase
Highlight the main features of the project with descriptions and screenshots if available.

### Future Features
- Future features will involve the generation of training plans based on the athletes needs. The plan will be generated for the athlete in their personal account, based on distance, skill level, elevation, tarining availability, and length of time until the event. This gives an extra edge over generic training plans that can be downloaded. This will expand on the current sorting system of finding a suitable training plan from the database.

### Code Validation

### HTML Code Validation

### HTML Validation Notes

During the HTML validation process, certain errors were identified, primarily related to dynamically generated template tags in Django, such as `{% static %}`, `{% block %}`, and `{% include %}`. These tags are not valid HTML and can cause validation errors when checked directly through tools like the W3C HTML Validator. Additionally, issues like duplicate `id` attributes and invalid element nesting were flagged. While these issues would typically warrant correction, the project has reached a late stage of development, making structural changes impractical due to potential disruption of existing functionality.

Instead, the focus has been on ensuring that the rendered HTML follows semantic standards as much as possible. In future iterations or projects, these issues can be addressed earlier in the development process to improve maintainability and validation compliance.

### Postgres SQL

For database management, this project utilizes Postgres SQL:

- The Code Institute provided a Postgres database for this project.
- Environment variables were used to securely manage and store database details, ensuring they are not exposed in the repository.

### Stripe Integration

#### **Overview**
Stripe is integrated into the project to handle payment processing, including card payments, checkout sessions, and webhook notifications. This section documents the key steps involved in setting up Stripe within the project.

---

#### **Key Steps in Integration**

1. **Install Stripe SDK**:
   - The project uses the official Stripe Python library to interact with Stripe's API.
   - Installation:
     ```bash
     pip install stripe
     ```

2. **Configure Stripe API Keys**:
   - The following API keys were configured in the `.env` file for secure storage:
     - **Publishable Key**: Used on the client side for Stripe Checkout.
     - **Secret Key**: Used on the server side for Stripe API calls.
     - **Webhook Secret**: Used to verify the authenticity of incoming webhooks.
   - Example `.env` configuration:
     ```env
     STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_publishable_key
     STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
     STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret
     ```

3. **Checkout Session Creation**:
   - A Django view was created to handle checkout session creation using Stripe's API.
   - This view specifies:
     - Payment methods (e.g., card).
     - Product details (name, description, price, quantity).
     - Success and cancel URLs to handle user redirection after payment.
   - Example configuration in `urls.py`:
     ```python
     path('create-checkout-session/', CreateCheckoutSessionView.as_view(), name='create_checkout_session'),
     ```

4. **Frontend Integration**:
   - The Stripe JavaScript library (`https://js.stripe.com/v3/`) was integrated into the project to redirect users to the Stripe-hosted Checkout page.
   - A "Checkout" button triggers the process, fetching a session ID from the backend and initiating the checkout flow.
   - Example JavaScript snippet:
     ```javascript
     const stripe = Stripe("your_publishable_key");

     document.getElementById("checkout-button").addEventListener("click", () => {
         fetch("/create-checkout-session/", {
             method: "POST",
         })
         .then(response => response.json())
         .then(data => stripe.redirectToCheckout({ sessionId: data.id }));
     });
     ```

5. **Webhook Integration**:
   - Webhooks were set up to handle events from Stripe, such as `checkout.session.completed`.
   - A webhook endpoint was added to listen for Stripe events and update order status in the database.
   - Example webhook flow:
     - Verify the webhook signature using the `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
     - Parse the payload to identify the event type.
     - Fulfill the purchase (e.g., mark an order as paid) based on the event.

6. **Testing Integration**:
   - Stripe's test mode and test card numbers were used to simulate different payment scenarios.
   - Stripe CLI was used to forward webhook events to the local development server:
     ```bash
     stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8000/webhook/
     ```

7. **Deployment**:
   - The Stripe webhook endpoint was updated in the Stripe Dashboard to point to the live server after deployment.
   - Environment variables were configured on the live server to secure the API keys.

---

#### **Key Endpoints**
- **Checkout Session**: `/create-checkout-session/`
- **Stripe Webhook**: `/webhook/`

### Heroku Deployment

To deploy your Django project on Heroku, follow these steps:

1. **Install Required Packages**:
   - Install `gunicorn` (WSGI HTTP Server for Python), `whitenoise` (to serve static files), and `psycopg2` (PostgreSQL database adapter for Python).

2. **Create a Heroku App**:
   - Log in to Heroku and navigate to **Create New App**.
   - Enter your app name and click on **Create App**.

3. **Set Config Vars**:
   - In the **Deploy** section, navigate to **Config Vars** and reveal them.
   - Enter the necessary configuration values. For this project, they were `SECRET_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`, `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`, `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`,. Additionally, `PORT:8000` and `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` (with a value of 1) were added during deployment.

4. **Configure ALLOWED_HOSTS**:
   - Add the Heroku host name to the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in `settings.py`.

5. **Deploy the Project**:
   - In the **Deploy** tab, select GitHub as the method of deployment, connect your repository, and manually deploy the branch.

6. **Finalize Deployment**:
   - Ensure `DEBUG` is set to `False` in your settings before final deployment.
   - After a successful deployment, `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` and `PORT:8000` can be removed from the Config Vars.
